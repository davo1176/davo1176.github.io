        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>his project explores the relationship between career progression factors and employee retention using the "HR-Employee-Attrition" dataset. The main goal is to understand how factors such as job level, years in a current role, years since the last promotion, monthly income, and stock option levels influence the length of tenure at a company. The analysis employs both statistical tests (T-tests) and regression models to draw insights into these relationships.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify significant career progression factors that predict employee tenure.</li>
        <li>Determine the impact of financial incentives on employee retention.</li>
        <li>Provide actionable insights for improving retention strategies through career development.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Key Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The regression analysis indicates that job level, years in a current role, and years since the last promotion significantly predict the number of years employees stay at a company.</li>
            <li>The Durbin-Watson statistic suggests no autocorrelation in the residuals, confirming the independence of variables.</li>
            <li>The R-squared value of 0.684 shows that the model explains 68.4% of the variance in employee tenure.</li>
            <li>Stock option levels were found to be statistically insignificant in predicting tenure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Initial analysis to understand the dataset, including size, shape, data types, and descriptive statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>T-tests:</strong> Two-sample tests to compare tenure between employees who left and those who stayed.</li>
            <li><strong>Regression Models:</strong> Multivariate linear regression to assess the impact of various predictors on employee tenure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Comprehensive exploratory analysis to identify patterns and outliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical Testing:</strong> Conducting and interpreting T-tests to compare means between groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Regression Modeling:</strong> Building and validating linear regression models to predict outcomes based on multiple predictors.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Creating plots (box plots, scatter plots, histograms) to illustrate findings and enhance understanding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)</li>
            <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
        </ul>
